title: Brecht & Churchill

You might already know a bit about Bertolt Brecht’s theory of alienation in performance, or Verfremdungseffekt. In translation it’s shorted to A-effect. I prefer “distancing effect,” but you do you.

In theater intro classes, the go-to example is audience interaction — breaking the fourth wall, removing the audience from complete narrative immersion. The songs in Vinegar Tom are effective in this and, as Gillian Hanna (the original Alice) admits, a little ham-handed. She responded to such criticism with some pretty incredible shade (bolded for emphasis):

“We didn’t want to allow the audience to get off the hook by regarding it a period piece, a piece of very interesting history. Now a lot of people felt their intelligence was affronted by that. They said: ‘I don’t know why these people have to punctuate what they are saying by these modern songs. We’re perfectly to able to draw conclusions about the world about the world today from historical parallels.’ Actually, I don’t believe that and, in any case, we can’t run that risk. For every single intelligent man who can draw parallels, there are dozens who don’t. It’s not that they can’t. It’s that they won’t.”

Brecht described theater as “historizing” its performed material, which is thought of as a form of distancing effect. He wrote that an audience member shouldn’t identify too closely with a character, that the closest they can come to empathy is recognizing “If I had lived under those same circumstances...” There’s a buffer of history, the difference between our present and the onstage past that allows for a critical attitude toward society. Brecht proposed that if we stage present-day plays with the same distance, as if they’re historical, we can dissect the circumstances that shape our own social impulses and biases.

A less nuanced version of this idea hides behind jokes that our grandkids’ unit of AP U.S. history about the Trump administration will be absolutely wild.

In Brecht’s idea of historization, history is a tool for analysis and not much more. An impulse criticism of distancing effect is that it’s cold, unfeeling, even sociopathic — that’s why I use “distancing” instead of “alienation.” For his purposes, say in The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui, emotion was a fascist manipulation that clouded critical thought.

Churchill and Monstrous Regiment held history in a different way.

Feminist-socialist historian Sheila Rowbotham, a leading figure in the UK Women’s Liberation Movement, said “the women’s movement has made many of us ask different questions of our past.” This is evident in both Churchill’s history plays and Monstrous Regiment’s impulse to stage political theater about women in history.

Vinegar Tom can be read as a feminist intervention on a history written by men. “Unfortunately, the witch herself—poor and illiterate—did not leave us her story,” Ehrenreich and English wrote in Witches, Midwives and Nurses. “It was recorded, like all history, by the educated elite, so that today we know the witch only through the eyes of her persecutors.”

A feminist interest in given (male) history is distinct from Brecht’s historization in that Vinegar Tom excavates centuries of oppression. The influential Feminist Criticism and Social Change calls the rewriting of women’s history as “not as an assortment of facts in a linear arrangement, not as a static tale of unrelieved oppression of women or of their unalleviated triumphs, but as a process of transformation.” 

Brecht was more interested in historicizing the present because he was privileged enough to be able to look at history and think, “That looks fine. I feel good about how this represents me as a white man.” (not a direct quote)

Churchill said in an interview “you tend to think of your own development as only having to do with yourself, and it’s exciting to discover it in a historical context.” We’re in a historical turducken here of us historicizing Churchill and Monstrous Regiment who historicized witch trials.
